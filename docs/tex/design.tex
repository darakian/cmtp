\section{Design}
\subsection{Interface}
The cipher mail transport protocol (CMTP) is designed to be a simple mail transport protocol (SMTP) replacement and to use much of the existing infrastructure used by SMTP. In particular CMTP server discovery is done through Domain Name System (DNS) queries for mail exchange (MX) records. Using MX records solves the problem of finding servers on the internet to process messages and makes the process of searching much easier. However, there are many SMTP clients on the internet and eventually there will be a connection attempt from an SMTP client to a CMTP server. This cross talk issue imposes an immediate constraint on CMTP in that it should speak a familiar language and given that SMTP has an ASCII command set so too does CMTP. The CMTP commands are described in the interface document, but it's worth stating here that the choice of the initiation command `OHAI' was chosen for 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item `OHAI' is a four character string and thus compatible with the earliest versions of SMTP. As such any SMTP client/server should fail in a defined way when speaking to a CMTP server/client.
  \item `OHAI' is a greeting and is consistent with `HELO' from SMTP and `ELHO' from ESMTP.
  \item `OHAI' makes me smile and I hope it makes you smile too.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Network}
CMTP is designed to be an open network. That is actors (Servers and users) are free to enter and exit at will. There is no central authority nor is there a system of communicating entry or exit from the network. This is like SMTP where any organization can set up their own server and communicate with the likes of google, microsoft, apple, etc\ldots
